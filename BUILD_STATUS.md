# 🚀 Evoworks Build Status

## ⚠️ EAS Setup Issue

EAS requires **interactive login** which I can't do automatically.

**But good news!** Your builds are already running on GitHub Actions! 🎉

---

## ✅ Your Builds Are Running Now!

### GitHub Actions (Already Building):

**Check status here:**
```
https://github.com/stonkbear/evoworks-mobile/actions
```

**What's building:**
- ✅ Android AAB (~10 mins)
- ✅ iOS IPA (~15 mins)

---

## 📱 Download Your Apps

### When builds finish:

1. Go to: https://github.com/stonkbear/evoworks-mobile/actions
2. Click on completed workflow (green ✅)
3. Scroll to "Artifacts"
4. Download:
   - **app-release** (Android AAB)
   - **app-ios** (iOS IPA)

---

## 🔄 To Use EAS Instead (Optional)

You'll need to run these commands **interactively**:

```bash
cd "/Users/zachreynolds/Desktop/Echos Marketplace"

# Login to EAS
npx eas-cli login

# Initialize project
npx eas-cli init

# Build both platforms
npx eas-cli build --platform all
```

**Benefits of EAS:**
- Faster builds
- Direct download links
- Easier signing
- Can submit to stores directly

## 🆚 Which to Use?

### GitHub Actions (Current):
- ✅ Already working
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ No setup needed
- ❌ Slower builds

### EAS (Optional):
- ✅ Faster builds
- ✅ Better UX
- ✅ Direct links
- ❌ Requires interactive setup
- ❌ Free tier: 30 builds/mo

## 💡 Recommendation

**Stick with GitHub Actions** for now - your apps are already building!

Switch to EAS later if you want faster builds.

## 🦇 Next Steps

1. ⏳ **Wait 10-15 mins** for builds
2. 📥 **Download** from GitHub Actions
